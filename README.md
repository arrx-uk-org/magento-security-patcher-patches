# Magento Patches

Welcome to the Magento Patch Exchange. This is an effort to collect all the Magento patches in one spot for both EE and CE. I have been neglectful in properly maintaining this repo but I have made some recent efforts to merge pull requests, answer issues and submit the latest EE patches.

## Reference to patches here
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MTbU9Bq130zrrsJwLIB9d8qnGfYZnkm4jBlfNaBF19M/edit#gid=192164130

## What to do?

If you have a patch that is not in this repo please open a pull request and I will merge the patch. If you see a patch that shouldnâ€™t be there or is just plain wrong, please tell me. I will investigate it and remove it if necessary.

## Issues

Please do not open a support ticket for your Magento site. The best place to get your Magento questions answered is here http://magento.stackexchange.com/
